# unkNOWn PNG
A lightweight CLI tool for exporting pixel data from PNG images into Macroquad-ready Rust functions using basic drawable shapes. Originally developed for personal use, this script simplifies the process of turning pixel art into code â€” perfect for prototyping, inlining game assets, or rapidly visualizing compositions in a Macroquad project.
